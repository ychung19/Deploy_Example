# "p5 starter pack"

## Project files:

- _index.html_ : serves to the browser and has a <div> with an ID and class name of "sketch-holder".

- _p5.min.js_ : is a minified JavaScript file of the p5.js library, and should not be altered. Doing so may break the functionality of the code.

- _sketch.js_ : contains the setup() and draw() methods that create the p5 canvas, and execute the code to draw within the canvas.

- _styles.css_ : contains all the styles being imported into index.js. This can be altered to style and make the p5 sanbox unique in it's appearance.
